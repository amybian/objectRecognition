# Kode with Klossy: AI Project
In this summer program, I developed iOS app w/ SwiftUI and Xcode to enable language learners to identify objects
using a camera and translate them into common slang.

# Video of App Demo
Because of the summer program NDA requirements, I can't share the code. 
Here is the demo video where my app can capture real world objects, identify them and show different common slang for 
those objects.
