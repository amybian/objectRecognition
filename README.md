# Kode with Klossy: AI Project
In this summer program, I am the main developer to develop iOS app w/ SwiftUI and Xcode to enable language 
learners to identify objects
using a camera and translate them into common slang.

# Demo Video
[Because of the program NDA requirements, we can't share the code.]
* This is the demo video where my app can capture real world objects in real time, identify and show different 
  common slangs in different languages for those objects.
